This inventory system was originally created by Error, Nepsy, and Weong. 

I have edited it for ease of use. 

To open the tool, find "Xiexe" at the top of the Unity Toolbar, go to "Tools" and then hit "Inventory Remapper"

To use the tool, drop the bone for wherever you want your inventory to be in the "Inventory Location" slot.
In the name field, type the name for what you want your animations to be.

Then, hit generate. 

The script will generate your inventory on the correct bone, and generate all the corresponding animation files. 

You can now move objects into your slots. 

To put objects in the inventory slots, position them relative to where you want, rotation, etc, in the scene, and then
drag them into the inventory by moving it to 

"Inv_(...) / Inv_X (Slot you want the item in) / Enable/ Disable / Object / YOURITEMHERE"


You can now create an animation override controller, and throw the generated enable/disable animations into the emote slots. 
The animations are generated under "InventorySysPrefabEdited / Editor / Generated / YOURBONENAME /"

You should now be good to go, and have a functioning inventory ready to go when you upload your avatar!

PLEASE NOTE: 

THIS SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT AND MAY HAVE BUGS, IF YOURE AVATAR GETS PUT INTO THE GROUND WHEN DOING THE EMOTE, SOMETHING WENT WRONG.
IF THIS HAPPENS, DELETE, AND REGENERATE THE ANIMATIONS. YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DELETE THE OLD INVENTORY OBJECT, YOU CAN KEEP IT AND DELETE THE NEW ONE.

THERE WILL BE UPDATES TO THE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE IT SOON, I JUST WANTED TO GET SOMETHING OUT BEFORE LEGACY ANIMATIONS WERE REMOVED SO PEOPLE HAD A CHANGE TO GET THIER STUFF WORKING BEFORE THEN.
